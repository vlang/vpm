# How to submit package

As soon as you made your own module and published it on github (or any git repo hosting **WIP**) you need to make sure that:

- `v.mod` is at the root of repo and has at least `name` field
- Repo is public accessable

> After each commit published package will be updated according to `v.mod` file.  
> Includes: name, description, categories, license

If everything is done right, next you go to [vpm.vlang.io/new](https://vpm.vlang.io/new) and after logging in via github you'll able to select that repo for publish.
